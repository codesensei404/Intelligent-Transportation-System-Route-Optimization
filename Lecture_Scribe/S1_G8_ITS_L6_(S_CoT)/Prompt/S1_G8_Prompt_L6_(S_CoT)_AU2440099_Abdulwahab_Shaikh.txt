Prompt-1: To generate the actual Scribe

Generate a lecture scribe suitable for exam preparation based on the provided context. While generating the Scribe, reason step by step through definitions, assumptions, proofs and example solutions exactly as presented in the provided context. Make sure you give the step by step derivation for the problems and example solutions. Make the logical flow explicit so that a student can follow the reasoning during revision. Do not introduce any material or derivation which is not present in the context.
